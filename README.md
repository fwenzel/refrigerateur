Réfrigérateur
=============

Collects the GIFs from chat.meatspac.es for great entertainment. And profit.
Scratch that. Not for profit.

How?
----
* Install the add-on by [clicking on this link in Firefox](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18779383/tmp/1310/refrigerateur.xpi). (Better download location to follow soon, bear with me ;) )
* Browse to http://chat.meatspac.es
* Look at your default download folder / meatspaces and watch as new gifs keep popping up.



Caveats
-------
* The add-on stores its data in $Download/meatspaces. This should be configurable, but for now it isn't.
* The add-on starts running when you browse to chat.meatspac.es. To disable, disable the entire add-on. It's restartless, so don't fret.
* These GIFs can get large over time depending on traffic. Every one of them is about 100k. If you run out of disk space, it's your own fault.
